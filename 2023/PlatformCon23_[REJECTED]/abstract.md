# Building and scaling Platforms and Platforms Culture at Startups

## Long Description

Platform engineering is just as crucial for startups as it is for bigger organizations like Twitter or Netflix, if not more, as it creates enabling technologies and culture for the various Engineering, Product Development, and Business use cases of organizations. Platform Engineering, done “suitably” right, can lead Companies to efficiently deliver high-quality, secure, compliant, robust, and reliable products to their customers. This talk proposes to share the lessons learned from setting up teams and building Platforms for Startups and Scaleups.

This talk proposes to share the lessons learned from setting up teams and building Platforms for Startups and Scaleups. The talk starts with how to imbibe Platforms philosophy in an Engineering org from the first Engineer, aligning platforms with the needs of the business, and staying adaptable while scaling. The talk follows up with strategies for developing platforms in constraints, adapting Platforms philosophy based on the constraints of time, knowledge, money, etc; decisions regarding suitable technologies and services, and iterating through feedback from customers and stakeholders, while supporting the rapid growth of the organization and the business. The talk discusses in detail the synonymity of Platform Engineering, DevOps, and SRE principles in practice and the silos created when Organizations dissect the practitioners of these principles in different teams. We discuss Open Sourcing Platforms within the Company to get contributions from Product, Design, and other teams. The talk also discusses the distribution of ownership of the Platforms. Toward the end, the talk presents a successful case study of Platform Engineering practices implemented successfully at 2 Startups. This talk is intended for Startup Founders, Engineering Leaders, Platform/DevOps/SRE Engineers, and anyone who shall benefit from getting a practical perspective on Platform Engineering. After the talk, the audience will take away a Framework for setting up a Culture of Platforms Engineering, and practical learnings and insights to build and scale platforms that can handle the demands of a growing user base, in a dynamic and fast-changing startup environment.


## Session Outline

### Introduction 
- Definition of Platform and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) -  The definition of SRE and it’s philosophies and practices need to be different for different organizations based on various factors. Google’s SRE practices are not a fit all framework.

- Importance of SRE culture for startups and scaleups - Setting up SRE culture from the start proves to be an important factor in an Organization’s growth as it defines how it grows and scales efficiently and delivers reliable and secure products.

- Objectives of the talk - To elaborate on the importance of setting the suitable SRE culture, tech and practices for startups.

### Imbibing SRE Philosophies in an Engineering Org 

- Alignment of platforms with the needs of the business - SRE Platforms and culture need to be aligned with the needs of the business and shouldn’t be just driven on industry trends and exciting technologies and practices.

- Staying adaptable while scaling - Initial tech-stacks, principles and philosophies of the SRE culture might not be applicable when the organization and business scales. Scenarios, people, requirements change. It becomes important to keep adapting to the changes.

- Setting up SRE culture from the first Engineer - It’s important and equally difficult to set-up the SRE culture with the founding Engineers completely focussed on building the product while in the Go-To Market and Product Market Fit stages of the company. Imposing the agency to setup SRE culture and platforms mid stage, may go wrong and not bring expected results.

### Strategies for Developing SRE Platforms in Constraints 

- Adapting SRE philosophy based on constraints - Startups, specially in the current market and beyond, have resource crunch and prefer to build with efficiency. Constraints of money, people, tech, time, etc can impact in they way an Organization wishes to implement SRE practices and culture.

- Decisions regarding suitable technologies and services - Kubernetes might not be the best orchestrator for deploying microservices, serverless functions might be more suitable than containerized microservices, Saas providers like Datadog, Honeycomb, and other managed services might be better than self hosting open source tools, but interfaces should be agnostic and not have a vendor lock-in to adapt for future needs smoothly.

### Synonymity of Platform Engineering, DevOps, and SRE Principles in Practice 

- Open Sourcing SRE within the Company to get contributions from other internal teams 

- Distribution of ownership of the SRE Platforms

### Case Study of Successful Site Reliability and Platform Engineering Practices Implemented at 2 Startups 

- Overview of the companies in various stages and their requirements 

- Approach taken to set up the SRE culture and platforms 
Lessons learned and key takeaways

### Why How Google or Netflix Do SRE is Not a Good Place for Startups to Start With 

- Discussion of the differences in the requirements and resources of startups and large organizations 

- Importance of understanding the specific needs of a startup before implementing SRE practices

### Conclusion 

- Recap of key takeaways 
- Framework for setting up a Culture of Site Reliability Engineering 
- Final thoughts and recommendations



## Target audience: 

Startup Founders, Engineering Leaders, Platform/DevOps/SRE Engineers, and anyone interested in learning practical perspectives on Site Reliability Engineering at startups and scaleups.
